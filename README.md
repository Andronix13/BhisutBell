This application will send you notifications on your mobile! About what? About the "NOTICE" section in our University website.  So, next time when a notice is added to the University Website, you don't have to download it and share in WhatsApp group! You can get the notification directly on your phone. The application is supported by an Python Script (Web-Scraping) which is hosted on Amazon AWS EC2 which checks the "NOTICE" section continuously every 15mintues
